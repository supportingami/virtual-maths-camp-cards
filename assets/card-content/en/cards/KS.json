    "statement": "<p>Remove the 10, J, Q, K, and Jokers. Deal each player 9 cards (A = 1 here). Players secretly arrange their cards to make a 4-digit number, a 3-digit number and a 2-digit number. All at once, the players show their three numbers.</p>\n<p>The biggest 2-digit number gets 2 points, biggest 3-digit gets 3 points, biggest 4-digit gets 4 points. If there is a tie then the points are split between the players.</p>",
    "further_instructions": "<p>You could play a certain number of rounds or play until a player gets to a certain score, e.g. 25.</p>",
    "strategy_tips": "<p>It is tempting to focus on making your 4 digit number as big as possible, but maybe everyone else is trying to do this too! It is important to watch how your opponents are playing and try and adapt your strategy to beat them.</p>"

  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>Try playing this so that the smallest 2-digit number gets 2 points, smallest 3-digit number gets 3 points and smallest 4-digit number gets 4 points. </p>"
