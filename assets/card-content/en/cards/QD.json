    "statement": "<p>How many different ways can you arrange teachers and students in a row of 5 chairs such that no 2 teachers are sat next to each other?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "13",
    "hint": "<p>You could have five students sitting on the five chairs. You could have two teachers sitting on chairs number 2 and 4 and students in chairs 1, 3, and 5. Can you think of any other options? Can you think of the maximum number of teachers that could sit on the chairs? You might like to start with a smaller number of chairs and work your way up.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>Think of chairs as having a teacher (x) or a student (o).</p>\n<p>For 5 chairs we can have</p>\n<p>ooooo, xoooo, oxooo, ooxoo, oooxo, oooox, xoxoo, xooxo, xooox, oxoxo, oxoox, ooxox, xoxox</p>\n<p>Total = 13</p>\n<p>There is a way we can build up to this solution by thinking about the answer if there was 1 chair, 2 chairs, 3 chairs etc. </p>\n<p>1 chair has 2 options: x , o</p>\n<p>2 chairs has 3 options: ox, oo, xo</p>\n<p>3 chairs has 5 options: oox, ooo, oxo, xox, xoo</p>\n<p>Each time you add a chair you can generate the new options by simply adding a student to the start of all the previous options. You can also add a teacher and then a student to all of the options from two chairs ago. Let's see this with 4 chairs:</p>\n<p>Add o onto all the 3 chair options gives:</p>\n<p>ooox, oooo, ooxo, oxox, oxoo</p>\n<p>And adding xo onto all the 2 chair options gives:</p>\n<p>xoox, xooo, xoxo</p>\n<p>This gives 5 + 3 = 8 options in total. </p>\n<p>For the 5 chairs we can add o onto all the 4 chairs options and and xo onto all the 3 chair options which gives 8 + 5 = 13 as before.</p>"

    "hint": "<p>Try and build up the answer from a smaller number of chairs.</p>",
    "correct_answer": "144",
    "explanation": "<p>We had already found the following sequence for 1 chair, 2 chairs, 3 chairs , \u2026 </p>\n<p>2, 3, 5, 8, 13</p>\n<p>Each term in the sequence can be found by adding the two previous terms. We can carry it on:</p>\n<p>2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144</p>\n<p>So there are 144 ways to have people sitting on the 10 chairs.</p>"

  "extension_2": {
    "statement": "<p>For all the number of chairs between 1 and 30 inclusive, how many of these will have an even number of ways of sitting on them?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Think about how the sequence is generated \u2026 can you find a pattern that repeats thinking about odd and even numbers?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "10",
    "explanation": "<p>For the sequence 2,3,5,8,13, \u2026 we can see that there is a pattern even, odd, odd, even, odd odd, etc. This makes sense as even + odd = odd and odd + odd = even. So every third number in the sequence is even. We need to do 30 \u2215 3 = 10. </p>"
