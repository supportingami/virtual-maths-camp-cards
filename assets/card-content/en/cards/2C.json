    "explanation": "<p>The five numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 add up to 15. If the pattern is continued for 2000 digits there will be 2000 \u2215 5 = 400 sets of these five numbers. 400\u00d715 = 6000.</p>"

    "statement": "<p>The pattern 1234...n,1234,...n,1234\u2026,n is carried on for 120000 digits. If the sum of these digits is 960000, what is n equal to? </p>",
    "hint": "<p>Try dividing 960000 by 120000. What does this answer represent?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "15",
    "explanation": "<p>960000 is the sum of all the digits. There are 120000 digits, so dividing 960000 by 120000 gives us the average of the digits. This is 8, so we are looking for a sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, \u2026 with an average of 8. This must be 1, 2, 3, \u2026, 15.</p>"

    "about": "<p>There is a formula for adding the numbers 1, 2, 3, \u2026, n together. It is \u00bd\u00d7n\u00d7(n + 1). For example 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 can be found by  \u00bd\u00d77\u00d78  = 28. </p>\n<p>The sequence of numbers that this formula gives are called triangular numbers. The first ten are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, and 55. </p>",
