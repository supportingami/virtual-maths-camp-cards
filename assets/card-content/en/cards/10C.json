    "statement": "<p>How many ways are there to draw four dots on a piece of paper such that whichever two dots you choose, the distance between these two points is one of only two possible values?</p>\n<p>Here is one correct example:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/images/Two_Distances_image_0.png\" class=\"Two_Distances_image_0\" /></p>",
    "correct_answer": "6",
    "hint": "<p>Try drawing an equilateral triangle. That will give you three points that are all the same distance from each other. Where could you put the fourth point?</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>If we call the two distances \"short\" and \"long\", then any such drawing of points must have a triangle with one long and two short edges (it's not quite obvious, but if you think about it a bit you can eliminate all other possibilities). Now where does the last point go? To each of the other 3 points, it's connected either via a long or a short edge, giving 8 possibilities. Try out each of them, you will notice that 2 of them do not work out, leaving 6 solutions.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/images/Two_Distances_image_1.png\" class=\"Two_Distances_image_1\" /></p>\n<p>Short edges are represented by <strong>blue</strong> while long edges are represented by <strong>green</strong>. One of these solutions can be extended to 5 points that only use two distances, see bottom right picture.</p>"

    "statement": "<p>In how many different ways can you draw 4 points in the plane whose pairwise distances are \u221a2, \u221a2, 2, \u221a10, \u221a10 and 4?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Try to figure out what kind of triangles you can make that use 3 of the 6 distances. If you have squared paper, it helps that it is possible to put all the vertices on the grid.</p>",
    "correct_answer": "2",
    "explanation": "<p>This set of distances is quite special! For most sets of pairwise distances, there is only one solution, but here there are two.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/images/Two_Distances_image_2.png\" class=\"Two_Distances_image_2\" /></p>"
