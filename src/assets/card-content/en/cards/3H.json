    "statement": "<p>10662526601 = 2201\u00b3 is the only known palindromic cube whose cube root is not palindromic (a palindrome is a number that reads the same backwards as forwards).</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Take the number 1030301. It is a palindrome. It's cube root is 101, which is also a palindrome. Can you find other examples that are both palindromes? (Remember that all one digit numbers are palindromes!)   </p>",
    "explanation": "<p>According to the On-line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, The sequence of positive integers whose cube is palindromic begins:</p>\n<p>1, 2, 7, 11, 101, 111, 1001, 2201, 10001, 10101, ...</p>\n<p>The corresponding sequence of palindromic cubes begins:</p>\n<p>1, 8, 343, 1331, 1030301, 1367631, 1003003001, 10662526601, 1000300030001, ...</p>\n<p>2201 is the smallest (and only one known so far) which is itself non-palindromic. </p>"

  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>There are 5 palindromic square numbers between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) whose square root is also a palindrome. Can you find them all?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Remember all one digit numbers are palindromes.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>The five numbers are 1\u00b2=1, 2\u00b2=4, 3\u00b2=9, 11\u00b2=121, 22\u00b2=484</p>"
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "about": "<p>People have used computers to try and find another palindromic number whose cube root is not palindromic but no one has found one. This might be because there exists one that is bigger than the numbers that have been tested so far, or it might be that no more exist. </p>",
