    "statement": "<p>The integer 12 is the first <strong>abundant number</strong>. Its proper divisors (factors not including 12 itself)  are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 which add up to 16 which is more than 12. </p>",
    "hint": "<p>You could make a 10 by 10 grid of the numbers 1 to 100 and colour in the abundant numbers.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>The next abundant number is 20, because the proper divisors of 20 are 1,2,4,5, and 10 which add up to 22. Can you explain why prime numbers can never be abundant?   </p>"
  },
  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>Numbers whose proper divisors add up to less than the number are called deficient numbers. </p>",
    "hint": "<p>You could make a 10 by 10 grid of the numbers 1 to 100 and colour in the deficient numbers.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>An example of a deficient number is 15, because 1,3, and 5 add up to 9 which is less than 15.</p>"
  },
  "extension_2": {
    "explanation": "<p>Take the proper divisors of 6, they are 1,2, and 3 which adds up perfectly to 6.</p>\n<p>6 is the smallest perfect number. Can you find the only other perfect number below 100?</p>"

  "additional_information": {
    "about": "<p>The first known classification of numbers as deficient, perfect or abundant was by Nicomachus in his Introductio Arithmetica (circa 100)</p>",
