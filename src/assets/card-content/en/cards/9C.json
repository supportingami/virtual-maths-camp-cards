    "statement": "<p>At a restaurant each table has 3 legs, each chair has 4 legs and all the customers and the three members of staff have 2 legs each. There are four chairs at each table. Three quarters of the chairs are occupied by customers and there are 206 legs altogether in the restaurant. How many chairs does the restaurant have?</p>",
    "correct_answer": "32",
    "hint": "<p>Can you work out how many legs there are at each table if three quarters of the chairs have people on them?</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>The three members of staff have six legs so take this off the total, giving 206 - 6 = 200. Now the tables, chairs and customers have 200 legs. On average, at each table there are 3 table legs, 16 chair legs and 6 customer legs (as only three quarters of the chairs are taken).This gives 3 + 16 + 6 = 25 legs per table. The number of tables is therefore 200 \u2215 25 = 8, hence the number of chairs is 8\u00d74 = 32. </p>"

  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>I have 30 coins. Some of the coins are 1\u00a2, some are 2\u00a2 and some are 6\u00a2. The value of the 6\u00a2 coins is worth the same amount as the total value of the 1\u00a2 coins and the 2\u00a2 coins combined. Given that I have a different number of each type of coin, what is the total value of all of the coins (in \u00a2)?</p>",
    "hint": "<p>Start by considering how many 6\u00a2 coins I could have...if I have too many, I won't be able to match their value with the 1\u00a2 coins and the 2\u00a2 coins.</p>",
    "correct_answer": "84",
    "explanation": "<p>First we suppose we have 8\u00d76\u00a2 coins, this has a value of 48\u00a2, with 22 coins remaining. The target value is always a multiple of six and therefore even, so we will require an even number of 1\u00a2 to make the even number. The largest even total among the rest of the coins is 20x2\u00a2 + 2x1\u00a2  = 42\u00a2, which is less than 48\u00a2.</p>\n<p>So at most we can have 7\u00d76\u00a2 = 42\u00a2, with 23 coins remaining. In this case the largest even total is  21x2\u00a2 + 2x1\u00a2  = 44\u00a2. Our target was 42\u00a2, thus we include more 1\u00a2 coins, and fewer 2\u00a2 coins. The next highest even total is 19x2\u00a2 + 4x1\u00a2  = 42\u00a2, hitting our target.</p>\n<p>Therefore the total value of all coins is 7\u00d76\u00a2 + 19x2\u00a2 + 4x1\u00a2 = 84\u00a2.</p>\n<p>For completeness, the smallest number of 6\u00a2 coins is 5 (choosing 4 gives a total of  24\u00a2 with 26 coins remaining). The solution with 5\u00d76\u00a2 is 5\u00d72\u00a2 and 10\u00d71\u00a2. The solution for 6\u00d76\u00a2 is 12\u00d72\u00a2 and 12\u00d71\u00a2. However neither of these solutions have a different amount of each coin.</p>"
