    "statement": "<p>Select the 16 J, Q, K and A cards from a pack. Try to put them in a 4 by 4 square so that each rank (J, Q, K, A) and each suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades) appears only once in each row and column.</p>",
    "further_instructions": "<p>This could be a one player puzzle or get a group of people to try it together as it is quite tricky! </p>",
    "strategy_tips": "<p>Start by ignoring the suits and try to get the ranks in a square so that each rank appears only once in every row and column. </p>"
  },
  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>Create a 5 x 5 square with the same rules but this time include all the 10,J,Q,K,A. You will need an extra suit: you could draw a 10, J, Q, K and A on five separate pieces of paper, making up a new suit of your choice.</p>"

  "additional_information": {
    "about": "<p>This puzzle is an example of a Latin square. Interestingly, if the problem had involved 6 ranks of playing cards it would have been impossible. But with 7 ranks it is quite easy to find a solution. Latin squares are used in medical trials to ensure every participant is allocated to each treatment for the same time period to prove which is the best treatment.</p>",
