    "hint": "<p>Starting with a small triangular number might help. Can you use the pattern of triangles and squares to help you? What square could be the sum of the 250\u1d57\u02b0 triangular number and another triangular number? Think about the 250\u1d57\u02b0 square number and how it relates to the 250\u1d57\u02b0 triangular number.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>Let us look at a smaller example first. We could find the 5\u1d57\u02b0 triangular number using this square:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_1.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_1\" /></p>\n<p>We are looking for the number of purple squares. We can do \u00bd\u00d7(5\u00d75 - 5) = 10 to get the pink triangle. And then adding on the 5 squares in the diagonal gives the purple triangle. So we have 15.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"assets/images/Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_2.png\" class=\"Square_Numbers_and_Triangular_Numbers_image_2\" /></p>\n<p>For the 250\u1d57\u02b0 triangular number, we are looking for the number of squares in the black \"triangle\". It will be roughly \u00bd\u00d7250\u00d7250, except that the diagonal will be included. So we calculate \u00bd\u00d7(250\u00d7250 - 5) to find the blue triangle and then add 250 on to find the black triangle. The answer is 31375.</p>\n<p>We can extend this logic to find a formula for the nth triangular number</p>\n<p>\u00bd\u00d7(n\u00d7n - n) + n = \u00bd\u00d7(n\u00b2 +2\u00d7n - n) = \u00bd\u00d7(n\u00b2 + n) = \u00bd\u00d7n\u00d7(n + 1)</p>\n<p>Check: \u00bd\u00d7250\u00d7251 = 31375</p>\n<p>Using the formula, we can also see that consecutive triangular numbers add to a square number. Consecutive triangular numbers can be represented as \u00bd\u00d7(n - 1)\u00d7n and \u00bd\u00d7n\u00d7(n + 1).</p>\n<p>If we add these consecutive triangular numbers and simplify we can find:</p>\n<p>\u00bd\u00d7(n - 1)\u00d7n + \u00bd\u00d7n\u00d7(n + 1)=  \u00bd\u00d7((n - 1)\u00d7n + n\u00d7(n + 1)) = \u00bd\u00d7(n\u00b2 - n + n\u00b2  + n) = n\u00b2 </p>"

    "about": "<p>The formula for the n\u1d57\u02b0 triangular number is also exactly equal to the summation 1 + 2 + 3 + \u2026 + n and so it is a quick way to add up lists of consecutive numbers! This formula was written down by the Irish monk Dicuil in about 816AD but was possibly already known to the Pythagoreans in the 5th century BC.</p>",
