    "correct_answer": "385",
    "hint": "<p>Can you start with a 4 by 4 square and work out how many squares there are? Remember to keep track of how many 1 by 1, 2 by 2, 3 by 3 and 4 by 4 squares you find.</p>",
    "explanation": "<p>There is one 10 by 10 square, four 9 by 9 squares, nine 8 by 8 squares, sixteen 7 by 7 squares .... one hundred 1 by 1 squares, all of which are square numbers. So we need to add all the square numbers from 1 to 100: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 385. </p>"

    "correct_answer": "105",

    "about": "<p>This is an example of a puzzle where it is best to start with a smaller number and work your way up to the solution. Many questions in maths can be approached in this way. Remember to record all your working neatly and you will be able to spot patterns more easily.</p>",
