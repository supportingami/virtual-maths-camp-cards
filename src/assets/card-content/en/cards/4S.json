    "statement": "<p>|</p>\n<p>| | |</p>\n<p>| | | | |</p>\n<p>Arrange 9 sticks in 3 rows as shown. Two players take it in turn to remove one or more sticks from a single row. The loser is the person to take the last stick. Can you find a winning strategy?</p>",
    "further_instructions": "<p>You can remove as many sticks as you like each turn as long as they come from the same row. For example an opening move could be to take all 5 sticks from the bottom row. You must take at least one stick each turn. You are trying to leave just one stick left for your opponent to be forced to take and therefore lose the game.</p>",
    "strategy_tips": "<p>Try to think a few moves ahead. For example if you can remove a stick to leave this pattern</p>\n<p>| |</p>\n<p>| | </p>\n<p>then you will be able to win.</p>\n<p>Try to work out if it is better to go first or second.</p>"

    "about": "<p>This is an ancient game that owes its current name to Charles Bouton, who also developed a theory for how you can always play to win. His strategy involves binary numbers and can be found here <a href=\"https://plus.maths.org/content/play-win-nim\">https://plus.maths.org/content/play-win-nim</a>. You can play different variations of the game (also called drips) online here https://wild.maths.org/tags/fun-drips</p>",
