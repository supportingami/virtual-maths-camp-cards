    "statement": "<p>This is a game for two or three players. Shuffle the deck and place it face down. The first player turns over the top card and continues turning over cards, adding together the value of each card, until they decide to stop and record their score. J = 11 and Q = 12.</p>\n<p>If an A or a K is turned over, no points are scored in that turn and the turn is finished.</p>\n<p>Players take turns until someone reaches 100 or more - this player is the winner.</p>",
    "further_instructions": "<p>If the cards are all turned over before the target is reached, just reshuffle the pack and continue. </p>",
    "strategy_tips": "<p>Try and keep count of how many K and A cards have come up already. This could change how daring you are feeling. If someone else is close to 100 it might be best to turn over more cards than you would normally.</p>"
  },
  "extension_1": {
    "statement": "<p>You could try changing the target number, or changing how many cards wipe out your score for that turn. You could also try having K as resetting your <strong>entire</strong> score to zero to make it more daring.</p>"
  },

    "about": "<p>This game can also be played with Dice and is sometimes called Pig. There are one and two dice versions, and even a version where you can choose how many dice to throw rather than how many times to throw a set number of dice.</p>",
